I am a data scientist with almost 10 years of experience in the field. First working at ArcelorMittal Inc, the world largest steel company, and now at Scopely Inc. in big actor in the mobile games landscape. Also, I am part of the teachers of the Data Science program at [Zrive](https://programs.zriveapp.com/data-science).

The original idea for this blog is to share things I wish I was taught when studying Data Science: mainly insights

Welcome!
