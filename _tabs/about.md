I am a data scientist with almost 10 years of experience in the field. First working at a steel company and now at Scopely Inc. a large mobile games developer. Also I am part of the teachers of the Data Science programme at [Zrive](https://programs.zriveapp.com/data-science).

The original idea for this blog is to share things I wish I was taught when studying Data Science: mainly insights

Welcome!
