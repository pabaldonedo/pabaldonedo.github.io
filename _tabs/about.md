Hi!

I an Pablo, a data scientist with almost a decade of experience in the field. I started my career at ArcelorMittal,the world’s largest steel company, and today I work at Scopely, a major player in the mobile gaming industry. Beyond my day-to-day work, I am also part of the teachers of the Data Science program at [Zrive](https://programs.zriveapp.com/data-science).


I created this blog to share the insights, lessons, and practical knowledge I wish I’d had when I was first learning data science — the kind of things that often get overlooked sometimes in courses but can make a difference in practice.

As for the name, All Iron: it comes from the old iron mines in northern spain. When miners discovered a sample of pure iron, supervisors would mark it with the phrase “All Iron!”—a moment worth celebrating. In the same spirit, I hope each post here feels like a small but valuable find for you.

Welcome!
